The Google Books module API is different based on the\r\ndata returned as well as the final aims of the module, although\r\nthey do both return book data.\r\n\r\nThe Google Books search can be done with many types of search strings.\r\n\r\nThere are many search options with Google Books and many options to\r\ndisplay that data within the Google Books module. The API pulls data\r\nfrom Google Books in a generic way.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
